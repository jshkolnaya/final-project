	<h2>My Current Favorite Teas!</h2>

	<h3>Bergamot Rose</h3>
	<img src="bergamotrose.jpg" width=200px height=auto alt="bergamot rose tea">
	<p>An herbal tea that I've really been enjoying for its pleasant citrusy floral flavor. I usually just get this one from the store and I like that it's loose leaf tea 
		despite being in tea bags.</p>
	<h3>Milk Oolong</h3>
	<img src="milkoolong.jpg" width=200px height=auto alt="milk oolong tea">
	<p>An oolong tea that I've been a fan of for a long time. I usually get this cheap bagged milk oolong from the store, but I do hope to get a much nicer higher quality 
	milk oolong in the future.</p>
	<h3>Matcha</h3>
	<img src="matcha.jpg" width=200px height=auto alt="matcha tea">
	<p>I'll always be in the mood for a matcha latte so this will be in my list of favorites permanently. This brand has good ceremonial grade matcha, but Ippodo is a 
	better brand for buying matcha so eventually I'd like to get some of that.</p>
	<h3>Honeybush Rooibos</h3>
	<img src="honeybushrooibos.jpg" width=200px height=auto alt="honeybush rooibos tea">
	<p>An herbal tea that has a nice mellow flavor, another store purchase that I've been enjoying a lot lately.</p>
	<h3>White Peony</h3>
	<img src="whitepeony.jpg" width=200px height=auto alt="white peony tea">
	<p>A white tea that's very delicate and floral, and tastes great cold brewed as well as hot. This one's from The Cultured Cup and it's my second time buying it 
	because the quality is really good.</p>
