		<h3>Why Make This Site?</h3>
	<p>I wanted to make this site because tea is one of my favorite things and I didn't have a good place to keep track of stuff like what teas I drink, information on 
		tea, and little related things that I felt I might want to share with friends and family from time to time. I also thought it would be helpful to be able to look 
	back at exactly what teas I've tried whenever I want to remember which ones I've had, and also be able to track roughly how much caffeine I'm consuming for health 
	reasons.</p>
	</div>
		<div class="box">
			<h3>What Next?</h3>
			<p>In the future I hope to continue expanding my tea collection and trying lots of interesting unique teas from around the world. I plan to keep logging all 
			the teas I drink on my site and hopefully expanding it eventually and adding more information and cool pictures and such.</p>
