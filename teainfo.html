		<h3>Starting from the Basics</h3>
		<p>All true teas are made from the leaves of a plant called Camellia Sinensis. There are also herbal teas, which aren't considered true 
			teas because they don't come from the Camellia Sinensis plant. True teas all have some amount of caffeine, with the amount depending on how the leaves are 
			processed, while herbal teas <span style="font-style: italic;">typically</span> don't have any caffeine. The flavor of true teas depends on how the leaves are 
		processed as well.</p>
		
	</div>
		<div class="box">
			<h3>White Tea</h3>
			<p>White tea is the least processed form of tea, sometimes made from the young leaves/buds of the Camellia Sinensis plant (like silver needle tea) and something from 
				more mature leaves (like white peony tea). The only processing it undergoes is the drying (to prevent oxidation) and withering (to get rid of 
				excess moisture) of the leaves. This results in white teas generally having a more subtle light flavor to them. White tea often has the lowest caffeine content 
			out of the true teas, primarily because it is meant to be brewed for a shorter duration and at a lower temperature than black tea for instance, lowering 
				caffeine extraction.</p>
			
	</div>
		<div class="box">
			<h3>Green Tea</h3>
			<p>Green tea is a more processed tea than white tea, undergoing withering of the leaves before they are steamed or pan-fried, and then rolled or shaped. Green 
			tea gets to oxidize a little more, but the oxidation is still halted pretty early on. These teas generally have a fresh bold flavor, usually stronger than white tea.</p>
			
	</div>
		<div class="box">
			<h3>Yellow Tea</h3>
			<p>Yellow tea is quite similar to green tea but far less common, with most people having never even heard of it. There's an added level of processing where the 
				leaves are wrapped in paper and then steamed, which slows oxidation and gives yellow tea a mellower sweeter flavor than green tea. Because of how much more 
			time and labor it takes to make yellow tea compared to other teas, there isn't very much of it that gets produced.</p>
			
	</div>
		<div class="box">
			<h3>Oolong Tea</h3>
			<p>Oolong tea comes in a very wide variety of flavors. In its processing the leaves are withered, allowed to partially oxidize, and then are rolled and dried. 
			Some oolongs are roasted an extra time as well. The level of oxidation depends on the specific variety of oolong tea, which is why the flavor can differ a lot 
			depending on the exact type.</p>
			
	</div>
		<div class="box">
			<h3>Black Tea</h3>
			<p>Also known as "red tea" in China, black tea is more processed than any of the previous types of tea. The leaves are withered, rolled, and then allowed to 
				oxidize fully. Black teas often have a very bold flavor, but do come in all kinds of flavors and can be milder flavored as well. This is generally the tea 
				category which some people may have with milk or sugar, due to the flavor of the tea typically being strong enough to not be masked by the flavors of milk 
				and sugar (which would drown out the subtle flavors of most white teas for instance). At 40-70mg of caffeine per 8oz cup, black tea is the tea category closest to 
				<span style="color: #66543e; font-weight: 700;">coffee</span> in terms of caffeine content.</p>
			
	</div>
		<div class="box">
			<h3>Dark Tea</h3>
			<p>Dark tea has various subtypes, the most famous of which is pu-erh tea. Dark tea is unique in that it goes through a post-fermentation process to give it its unique 
			flavor. After the leaves are withered and rolled, they spend weeks or months undergoing microbial fermentation before finally being dried and oftentimes compressed into 
			cakes for people to buy. Some dark teas are also aged for years, allowing the flavors to change in interesting ways.</p>
			
	</div>
		<div class="box">
			<h3>Herbal Tea</h3>
			<p>Herbal teas, also known as tisanes or infusions, are "teas" made from any plants other than the tea plant Camellia Sinensis. These teas can be made with herbs, 
			spices, fruits, flowers, leaves, roots, grasses, etc. Most are entirely caffeine free, but a select few may have caffeine from plants like yerba mate or guayusa.</p>
			
	</div>
		<div class="box">
			<h3>Matcha</h3>
			<p>Matcha is a green tea, but I wanted to give it its own category here because of its uniqueness as a tea made from whole leaves in powdered form. Since you're consuming 
			more of the leaf than with standard green tea by drinking the powder with your tea, you get a much stronger flavor and also more caffeine.</p>
			
	</div>
		<div class="box">
			<h3>Western vs Eastern Style Brewing</h3>
			<p>There are two very different ways of brewing tea, eastern and western. There are various brewing methods within the eastern category really, but for now I'll just 
			be speaking specifically on the gongfu brewing style rather than any others because gongfu brewing is the most popular one at the moment and yields great tasting 
			tea. Western style brewing involves using a smaller amount of tea leaves and larger amount of water to brew your tea, generally only steeping the leaves one time 
			for a few minutes or a bit longer. Gongfu brewing on the other hand uses a larger amount of tea leaves with a smaller amount of water, and it's best to brew the tea 
			in a gaiwan or something similar. Unlike with western style, there are multiple steeps which start off being 5-30 seconds each and gradually increase with each steep. 
			After each steep, you pour the tea out into cups and then continue with doing however many steeps you want before the tea leaves lose too much of their flavor. Gongfu 
			brewing allows you to experience the flavors of teas in a different way and sometimes unlocks more complex flavor profiles that you wouldn't be able to get through 
			western brewing.</p>

			<h3>Everything Else</h3>
			<p>Naturally there's far more I haven't dived into because there's plenty I still don't know and I can't spend countless hours writing, but I hope to add more to 
			this evenetually!</p>
